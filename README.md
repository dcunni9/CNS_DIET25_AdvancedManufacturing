## Purpose

The deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) presents an opportunity to modernize the nuclear supply chain through the adoption of advanced manufacturing (AM) techniques. Despite this potential, the lack of established codes, standards, and regulatory pathways for AM in nuclear applications remains a significant barrier. Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) and InnoTech Alberta are currently collaborating on a project, funded through the NRCan Enabling SMRs program, that aims to address these challenges by developing a comprehensive guideline for the qualification and deployment of AM-fabricated components within the Canadian nuclear regulatory framework.

## Methods
This 3-year project focuses on fabricating a scaled SMR component using powder bed fusion (PBF) and direct energy deposition (DED), performing material testing and metallographic analysis, and establishing guidelines on integrating AM into the nuclear supply chain. Component selection was guided by a survey of (600+) international stakeholders in the nuclear sector, with (20) respondents identifying critical supply chain gaps. Amongst these, advanced high temperatures thermal heat exchangers operating in molten salt reactors (MSRs) were identified as a high-priority application for AM.

In Year 1 (2025), the project team is selecting a demonstration component, defining material, procurement, and quality assurance requirements, and developing detailed manufacturing, inspection, and test plans (MITPs). Year 2 (2026) will focus on fabricating demonstration components and test coupons, followed by extensive material characterization and analysis. In Year 3 (2027), the objective is to document the manufacturing and testing outcomes and draft guidelines on integrating AM into the nuclear supply chain. These generated guidelines are ultimately intended to guide the development of future standards for nuclear applications, particularly those that support the qualification of AM components. 

This presentation describes the project structure, deliverables, and the latest findings and developments. We acknowledge the support of Natural Resources Canada (Enabling Small Modular Reactors Program) for this work.
